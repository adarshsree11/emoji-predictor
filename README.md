train_emoji.csv - for training our model

##Algorithm's Used
-RNN
-LSTM

##Emoji Prediction.ipynb
This python script contains the code for both the models and their predictions.

##Additional Files
In this project, I have used the 6B 50D glove vector to build embedding matrix of words available in the glove vector.
Download the 6B.50.50d.txt file and extract the file in the same directory as that of the code.
